Here are some of the relevant courses that I've taken (or am currently taking) here at UC Berkeley, alongside some of my personal thoughts/experiences about them (WIP)! As a sidenote, I was pursuing the premed path for the first two years before I decided to switch to a more physics/math/engineering bend.
