Here are some projects that I've worked on!

- [Lorenz Attractors Visualization](https://github.com/arataishikawa11/Butterfly-Effect-and-Lorenz-Attractors)
In this project, I wanted to create a simple program that can draw out the famous Lorenz Attractors that can be visualized from plotting the Lorenz equations, 
which govern a chaotic system.
