Hi, I'm Arata and I'm currently a student at the University of California, Berkeley studying Engineering Physics. Thanks for visiting my site.

My main research interests broadly involve fluid dynamics, computational physics and biophysics. I'm also interested in GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Controls) systems engineering! Feel free to to reach out to me at arataishikawa@berkeley.edu!
You can also find me on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/arataishikawa" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn.</a>

## My Journey Thus Far

### High School
Two Software Engineering Interships with Intuit (2022) and Roku (2023). I focused very heavily on AP CS courses during my time in high school. However, I inevitably chose to apply to university for the physical sciences, namely Astrophysics due to being inspired by the book [*Three Body Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel)) by Liu Cixin.

### University
Before starting my coursework, I found out about the Engineering Physics major, and so I kept that in the back of my mind, knowing the difficulty in transferring from the College of Letters & Science to College of Engineering. Originally pursuing Astrophysics coursework, I realized very early on that I enjoyed analytical dynamics (especially non-linear dynamics) and so opted to then major in Physics. (Note that the declaration requirements for Physics and Astrophysics are exactly the same). During this time, I was also very interested in space health/space medicine and so I chose to also go down the Premed track and take the required courses necessary to apply to medical school. This was around the time I started my undergraduate research position with the [Yildiz Lab](https://www.yildizlab.org/), led by Professor Yildiz.

As I entered my ~2nd/3rd year, I also became very interested in fluid mechanics, especially turbulent flow. This followed from my interest in Chaos Theory (hooked by the book [*Chaos: Making a New Science*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos:_Making_a_New_Science) by James Gleick). Realizing that the Physics Department does not have a fluid mechanics course, I then decided to switch to Engineering Physics in an attempt to be able to take coursework in this field. Outside of courses, I work with the [FLOW Lab](https://flow.berkeley.edu/) led by [Projessor Makiharju](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/simo-makiharju/), as well as the [Space Sciences Laboratory](https://www.ssl.berkeley.edu/) with [Ramanakumar Sankar](https://ramanakumars.com/), Dr. [Mike Wong](https://research.ssl.berkeley.edu/~mikewong/bio.php), and Professor [Philip Marcus](https://cfd.me.berkeley.edu/people/philip-marcus/).
